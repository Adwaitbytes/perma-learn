# AOS 

> NOTE: This is very experimental, use for research and development purposes only.

## Requirements

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 20+

## Getting Started

```sh
# Generate arweave Wallet
npx -y @peramweb/wallet > wallet.json
# Boot up AOS
npx -y @permaweb/aos@latest wallet.json
```

The wallet creates a personal process that allows you to use as a repl, you can send it commands and it will evaluate and return output.

## About

AOS is a REPL that connects to a Personal AOS Process in the AO network. The AO network is a messaging passing process architecture. A Personal AOS Process is like a CPU on the Arweave Network. This repl will allow you to pass LUA expressions to your process, and those expressions get evaluated and return output to your screen.  

## Examples

When you boot up the OS, you can use https://lua.org to run expressions on your AOS Process.

First try "Hello AOS" - the return keyword sets the output variable that is passed to the output on the screen.

```lua
"Hello AOS"
```

You should get `Hello AOS`

> What is happening here? You input, is getting wrapped in an signed AO message and submitted to a `mu` or messenger unit, which then forwards it to a `su` or Sequencer Unit, then the REPL app, calls the `cu` compute unit to evaluate the AO Message with your Personal Process. This generates output to be returned for display.

Lets try another expression:

```lua
1 + 41
```

You should get `42` the answer to the universe :P

So, thats cool, you can send expressions to the AO network and get them evaluated and get a response.

You can also set variables:

```lua
a = "Hello AOS"
```

Then type `return a` and you should get `Hello AOS`, neat

You can also create functions:

```lua
sayHi = function (name) return "Hello " .. name end
return sayHi("Sam")
```

You should get `Hello Sam`

Woohoo!

We can also pass messages to other AOS Processes!

```lua
return send("ohc9mIsNs3CFmMu7luiazRDLCFpiFJCfGVomJNMNHdU", "ping")
```

Or you can check your messages ( by creating a message check function)

```lua
list()
```

```

### handlers

With `aos` you can add handlers to handle incoming messages, in this example, we will create a handler for "ping" - "pong".

In the `aos` repl, type `.editor`

```lua
handlers.append(
  function (msg)
    for i, o in ipairs(msg.Tags) do
      if o.name == "body" and o.value == "ping" then
        return -1
      end
    end
    return 0
  end,
  function (msg)
    ao.send({body = "pong"}, msg.From)
  end,
  "pingpong"
)
```

Then type `.done`

>  This will submit a handler to listen for messages that have a `body` tag with a value of `ping` then send back a message `pong`.

Once added you can ping yourself!

```lua
send(ao.id, "ping")
```

And check your inbox, you should have gotten a `pong` message.

this utility function finds the `body` Tag of the last message in the inbox and returns the `value`

```lua
utils.find(utils.propEq("name")("body"))(inbox[#inbox]).value
```
